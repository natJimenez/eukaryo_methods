Directories
------------

/AuReMe_test:
Contains GEMs generated using AuReMe alternative modes.

/biomass_analysis:
Contains descriptions of reference model biomass composition and, for each draft model, classifications of such biomass metabolites according to presence and producibility.

/compartment_analysis:
Contains a summary of duplicated reactions (i.e. appearing in multiple compartments) and the relation between the GPRs of such reactions.

/DB:
Metabolite and reaction databases (from KEGG, BiGG, modelSEED and MetaNetX).

/figures:
Figures included in the body of the manuscript.

/mappings:
Contains model reaction and metabolite mappings to the common MetaNetX namespace, for model content comparison.

/memote_results:
Contains JSON files summarizing Memote analysis results for each draft and reference model. These files are organized in subfolders named after each reconstruction method (including a "reference" subfolder).

/models:
Contains the generated draft models and the reference models. These are organized in subfolders named after each reconstruction method (including a "reference" subfolder).

/specialized_metabolites:
Contains lists of metabolites which are present in specific organisms according to metabolomic datasets.

/supplementary_material:
Supplementary material.
