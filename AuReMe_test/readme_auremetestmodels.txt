AuReMe models:

annotation_only (aureme2): only with pathway tools .dat files as input, no orthologs and draft model is included.
models_merge (aureme3): consist on final models after merging annotation data (from .dat files) as well as orthology data with alternative templates. In this case both A. aegypti and C. griseus models are reconstructed with the human genome-scale model Recon as a draft, for E. siliculosus a genome-scale model of S. Japonica was used as a draft.
models_orthology_only (aureme4): models obtained only using orthology data (orthofinder) together with original templates using for aureme models depicted in the manuscript (i.e. D. melanogaster for A. aegypti, M. musculus for C. griseus, and C. reinhardtii for E. siliculosus). Orthologs for alternative templates described in models_merge are analyzed using the suffix aureme5.
